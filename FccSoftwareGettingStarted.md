# Getting started with FCC software

The FCC software is the common software for the FCC detector design study. We support the whole chain starting
from event generation through parameterized and full detector simulation and data analysis.

## Where do I start?

Depending on what you want to do, there are different starting points in the FCC software stack. The following flow
chart should get you to the point where you know where to start and what you need to setup:

## Where do I learn more?

The chart hopefully let you select the starting point for what you want to do. If not, feel free to contact our
mailing list: fcc-experiments-sw-devATSPAMNOTcern.ch

If you know where to start, have a look at the [index page](./README.md) to see the documentation of the end-point where you landed in
the flow chart. There should be sub-chapters on the specific topics that will get you started.

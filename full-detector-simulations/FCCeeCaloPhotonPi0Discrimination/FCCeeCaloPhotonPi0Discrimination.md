# FCC-ee photon/pi0 discrimination using noble liquid calorimeter



:::{admonition} Learning Objectives
:class: objectives

This tutorial will teach you how to:

* produce flat ntuples from full simulation samples using FCCAnalyses
* infer state of the art deep learning within FCCAnalyses
* produce discrimination **plots** single photons/pi0
:::


First, make sure your setup of the FCC software is working.
You can check that the command to run jobs in the Gaudi framework is available on the command line:

```bash
which fccrun
```
**Change link below, does not work**
If you don't see a valid path like `/usr/local/bin/fccrun`  you should consult [the documentation page on FCCSW setup](https://github.com/vvolkl/fcc-tutorials/blob/master/FccSoftwareGettingStarted.md)

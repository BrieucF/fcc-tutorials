# FCC: tracking and vertexing example using specific flavour decays


:::{admonition} Learning Objectives
:class: objectives

This tutorial will teach you how to:

-   run over a specific flavour decay in **FCCAnalyses**
-   produce **flat ntuples** with observables of interest with **FCCAnalyses** and reconstruct the specific decay chain
-   build your own algorithm for a specific flavour decay inside **FCCAnalyses**
